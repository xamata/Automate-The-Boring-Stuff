# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Projects
This repository contains all the mini projects that I have been completing at the end of every chapter of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. This repo acts as an archive to come back to and check how I solved a problem. Most are these are done by me, however, there are some that I resorted to online help. I will state within the file if this code was obtained from somewhere other than my own brain. 

Thank you for taking the time to look through my profile, I hope you find something useful in here. Cheers!
